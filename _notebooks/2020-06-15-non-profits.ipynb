    "There is a growing disparity in access to tech, and in turn, access to data.  You have to have a certain income to afford a smart phone and a level of understanding to sign up for tech services, yes.  But I'm particularly interested in the disparity in access to tech _across organizations_. Large, for-profit hospitals can afford more expensive electronic health records and billing tools than a small non-profit organization that serves the homeless. This disparity means that organizations serving individuals with low socioeconomic status have limited access to tools that can automate repeating processes, build basic reports, send data extracts to partners and funders, and generally spend less time entering and processing data.

    "This post is going to review the cost of different technical solutions non-profits might use, how things like grant structures prohibit them from engaging technology, how that keeps them from doing what they want, and finally what technologists can do to fill the gap and support them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-profits and government agencies, there's not a lot of passive (legal) revenue to the organization, so we're gonna cover that choose-your-own-adventure style.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in tech, start here.  If you are a non-profit, I'm going assume you're familiar with funding.  Start [further down](#SaaS-Me-If-You-Can).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Making money the hard way \n",
    "## A primer for folks who haven't hustled to avoid revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the assumption that all non-profits need some amount of funding. The most common methods for getting these funds are:\n",
    "1. Donations \n",
    "2. Grants\n",
    "3. Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Donations\n",
    "For the sake of not letting myself ramble, we're going to focus on financial donations. Many non-profits exist on the model of donations of goods (like Goodwill), selling those goods, and then generating operating costs from those goods. It's a financial model.  It exists. The end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-profit organizations normally accept financial donations, but simply relying on someone to wake up and think \"you know what, I'm going to send a check to United Way today\" is probably not going to result in a reliable stream of income, if any income at all.  If a non-profit wants a reliable amount of funds from donations, they need a fundraising campaign.  Fundraising campaigns are not free - if Susan G. Komen spends $200,000 buying fancy pink shoes for football players and raises $800,000 (in an imaginary land in which you can directly attribute all financial donations to a single campaign), they're actually raising $600,000.  They spent 25 cents for every dollar raised.  In order to include this money in an annual budget, the non-profit needs to hold regular fundraising campaigns.  This is why most non-profits will employ a Fundraising Coordinator or Marketing Specialist.  If they plan on relying on donations as a revenue stream, they need to efficiently and consistently fundraise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Services\n",
    "Some non-profits receive funding for their programs through direct services given to members.  For example, a non-profit that offers Medication Assisted Treatment may submit insurance claims for participants who have received services through the non-profit.  Most insurance companies will have set money amounts for each procedure reported on each claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Services may also come in the form of goods, like yellow silicone bracelets that are $3 beacons of virtue...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grants\n",
    "Grants are a sum of money given to an organization for a specific purpose.  Grants come in two basic flavors: a sweet but tangy public grant or an earthy, umami private grant.  In my experience, private grants are a little less stringent with their requirements but here's a basic breakdown of how to receive and use grant funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)**\n",
    "Grant agency puts out an FOA (it's the government, did you think there wasn't an acronym?) that specifies what the grant is for, how much you could receive, who is eligible, timeline, and how to apply.  Federal FOA's are almost humorously specific, like this \"[Small Grants Program for Leading English Discussion Groups in Sapporo, Japan](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html)\" \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Application and Award**\n",
    "Agency seeking funding writes up their grant application (which usually is about the size of a graduate thesis) including a need statement, program narrative, proposed budget (or a budget narrative), discussion of impact, blood type, head shots, and $20 worth of pennies from 1960. Some of those are a joke but grant applicants have to be really careful what they include in their applications, using specific language, as the submissions are filtered through an [automated](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_2.jsp#IIC2) check initally. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Administration**\n",
    "Remember that grant budget you put in your application?  Now you have to stick to it. The grant will specify how much money is allotted for each component: personnel, services, materials, etc.  Grant awardees are required to not only stick to these budgets, but also report weekly to the funding agency. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-year grants, awardees are oftentimes required to re-apply (with the understanding that they will still receive the grant).  Funding agencies may adjust the amount of funds given to awardees at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

    "Back in the day, I was the data manager for two federal grants that were implemented by a state government.  Our grant provided direct services for citizens, so a portion of the grant was earmarked for those costs.  We were required to spend a certain percentage of grant funds on direct services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The program I worked for required a 60/40 split when it came to direct services.  This means we had to spend at least 60% of our allotted money on paying for medical services for our participants.  The grant also required that we report very specific data elements from those services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the grant was federally funded but implemented at the state level, the program was responsible for both salary and benefits for all employees.  The Program was also responsible for paying an administrative fee to the state - for using state resources (internet, office space, legal services, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of easy math, let's say the program was granted $1,000,000."
